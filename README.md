## Research Motivation

RNA structure prediction remains a major challenge in computational biology,
with implications for drug discovery and biological engineering.
This repository explores transformer-based approaches for learning
sequence-to-structure representations using publicly available benchmark datasets.

## Research Questions

- Can transformer architectures capture long-range dependencies required
  for structural prediction?
- How does sequence-only modeling compare to structure-aware approaches?

## Methodology Overview
RNA Sequence → Tokenizer → Transformer Encoder → Regression Head → 3D Coordinates

## Experimental Design

Dataset: Public benchmark dataset.

Baseline: simple regression models.

Evaluation: structural similarity metrics.

## Observations

Early experiments suggest the model captures long-range relationships,
though geometric constraints remain challenging.
