## Research Motivation

RNA structure prediction remains one of the most challenging problems in computational biology due to the complex relationship between nucleotide sequence and three-dimensional structural conformation. Accurate prediction of RNA folding has significant implications for drug discovery, synthetic biology, and understanding molecular function.

Traditional approaches often rely on physics-based simulations or handcrafted heuristics, which may struggle to scale efficiently across diverse RNA sequences. Recent advances in deep learning suggest that data-driven models may learn structural representations directly from sequence data by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual relationships.

This project explores whether modern transformer-based architectures can contribute to sequence-to-structure modeling by learning implicit structural constraints from publicly available benchmark datasets. Rather than focusing solely on optimization for competition metrics, the goal is to investigate methodological strategies and research questions relevant to scalable AI-driven structural prediction.

## Research Questions

This research investigates several key questions:

Can transformer architectures effectively capture long-range dependencies necessary for predicting RNA structural configurations?

To what extent can sequence-only modeling approaches approximate structural relationships without explicit geometric priors?

What architectural or training modifications improve the representation of structural context in RNA sequences?

How do data-driven approaches compare conceptually with traditional physics-based or rule-based folding methods?

What limitations arise when applying general-purpose sequence models to highly structured biological problems?

## Methodology Description

The overall methodology follows a sequence-to-structure learning paradigm.

Data Representation

RNA sequences are treated as structured token sequences. Preprocessing involves tokenization of nucleotides and optional feature encoding designed to preserve positional context.

Model Architecture

Transformer-based architectures are explored due to their ability to model long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms. The model learns contextual relationships between nucleotides that may correspond to structural interactions.

Prediction Objective

The learning objective focuses on predicting structural attributes or coordinate representations derived from RNA folding data. The goal is to assess whether learned representations capture meaningful structural relationships.

Training Strategy

Experiments evaluate training configurations emphasizing generalization and representation learning rather than dataset-specific optimization.

Evaluation Approach

Model behavior is evaluated using structural similarity metrics and analysis of prediction stability across sequences.

## Experimental Design

The experimental setup is designed to explore methodological insights rather than leaderboard performance.

Baseline models are compared against transformer-based approaches to understand representation improvements.

Experiments analyze the effect of sequence length and context window on structural prediction.

Model behavior is examined qualitatively to identify patterns in learned structural relationships.

Ablation studies investigate the role of positional encoding and attention mechanisms.

The objective is to understand architectural trade-offs and identify promising research directions.

## Limitations (Detailed)

Several limitations are acknowledged:

Transformer models do not explicitly incorporate geometric or physical constraints inherent in RNA folding.

Structural prediction may benefit from inductive biases that encode symmetry or spatial invariance.

Benchmark datasets may introduce biases that limit generalization to unseen biological contexts.

Sequence-only modeling may struggle to capture complex tertiary interactions without additional structural signals.

Recognizing these limitations is important for guiding future research toward hybrid modeling approaches.

## Future Research Directions

Future work will explore:

Geometry-aware neural architectures such as SE(3)-equivariant networks.

Hybrid models combining data-driven learning with physics-informed constraints.

Integration of secondary structure signals or graph-based representations.

Multi-task learning approaches combining structure prediction with functional annotation.

Agentic AI workflows that assist in scientific hypothesis generation for structural modeling.

These directions aim to bridge the gap between deep learning and biological structural reasoning.
